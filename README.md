Vectorial Tessellation
This is not compression. This is cartography. It operates on the principle that a linear string is a poorly-projected map of a higher-dimensional reality. The goal is to find the original coordinate system of this map and describe its features with the language of geometry, rather than painstakingly listing every point of interest in a one-dimensional transcript. The resulting string is shorter because a blueprint is more honest than a travelogue.

Conceptual Framework
A string is a starfield. Each character is a star. A traditional compression algorithm sees this as a list of stars and their brightness. Vectorial Tessellation sees this as a celestial sphere and searches for the constellations. It knows that the stars of Orion's Belt are not a mere sequence, but a geometric truth. Instead of storing the coordinates of each star, we store the vector that draws the belt. This vector is the pattern, in its purest form.

The engine does not look for repeating substrings. It wraps the string into matrices of varying dimensions and looks for alignmentsâ€”for characters that fall into straight lines. The final, "compressed" output is a set of geometric rules for repainting the most significant alignments, and a dusting of the truly random, unaligned "star-stuff" that remains.

Mechanism
Candidate Generation: The All-Angles Scan
The engine performs a comprehensive survey of the string's latent geometry. For each unique character (e.g., 'a'), it attempts to find its "constellations."

Matrix Permutation: The linear string is wrapped into matrices of every possible width. For a string of length L, it is tested as a 2x(L/2) grid, a 3x(L/3) grid, and so on. Each width creates a new projection, a new potential star chart.

Line Finding: Within each of these projections, the engine searches for alignments. It performs a brute-force search for lines that pass through the maximum number of instances of the target character. Any such alignment that provides a net reduction in data (i.e., the description of the line is smaller than the list of characters it represents) is cataloged as a "vector candidate."

Multi-Matrix Allowance: A single character, say 'x', might form a strong diagonal line in a 10-character-wide matrix, and a different vertical line in a 30-character-wide matrix. Both are considered valid, independent candidates for explaining the position of 'x'.

Optimal Selection: The Constellation Prize
All generated vector candidates from all characters across all matrix widths are placed into a single pool. They are then subjected to a competitive, greedy selection process.

Candidates are sorted by the "informational savings" they provide.

The highest-scoring candidate is chosen. The character instances it describes are now "claimed."

The engine proceeds down the list, selecting the next-best candidate only if it does not attempt to claim any already-claimed character instances. A star can only belong to one constellation.

The Blueprint: Celestial Mechanics & Stardust
The process concludes when no more profitable, non-conflicting candidates can be chosen. The output consists of two parts:

The Vector Key: A list of the winning geometric rules. Each entry is a vector, containing the character, the matrix width that revealed it, and the line's coordinates. This is the set of constellations.

The Remnant Stream: The characters that could not be mapped to any efficient vector. This is the cosmic dust, the aperiodic noise between the constellations, which is then passed to a final-stage statistical analysis for any remaining compressibility.

Reconstruction is the act of re-painting the starfield. An empty canvas of the original string's length is prepared. The Vector Key is used to draw the constellations. The decoded Remnant Stream is then used to fill in the stardust. The original text reappears, not as a sequence, but as a completed map.
